      <p>I am a Visiting research scholar at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra </a> and works closely with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a>. My research interests lies at the intersection of software engineering and AI research. I’m enthusiastic to build large scale machine learning systems in order to help the research community. I’m also excited about deep learning with its application in computer vision and natural language processing. I also lead <a href="http://cloudcv.org/" target="_blank">CloudCV</a> which is an open source organization, building tools for reproducible AI research.</p>

      <p>During my undergraduate studies, I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/4507838760091648/" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code student (2017) </a> with <a href="http://cloudcv.org/" target="_blank"> CloudCV </a> and also mentored students in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/4538857819209728/" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code (2018) </a> for the same organization in 2018. Parallel to CloudCV; I was also member of <a href="http://hackncs.com/" target="_blank">Nibble Computer Society</a> and worked on really impactful projects like <a href="http://210.212.85.155/" target="_blank"> JSS InfoConnect </a> (20000+ users, 5000+ daily active users etc).
