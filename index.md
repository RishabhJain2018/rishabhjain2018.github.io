      <p>I am Rishabh Jain, a senior undergraduate student at JSS Noida interested in machine learning, specifically solving problems using deep learning techniques.</p>

      <p> I am an open source contributor to <a class="talk-title" href="http://cloudcv.org/" target="_blank">CloudCV</a>,  Organization which aims to make AI research reproducible. At CloudCV, I currently work on <a href="https://evalai.cloudcv.org/" target="_blank">EvalAI</a> Project and help in designing and implementing core features. I was selected as <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/6419112360148992/" target="_blank">Google Summer Of Code 2017</a> student and worked on the same project, <a href="https://evalai.cloudcv.org/" target="_blank">EvalAI</a>.

      <p>Prior to CloudCV; I was a member of <a href="http://hackncs.com/" target="_blank">Nibble Computer Society</a> working on really impactful projects like <a href="http://210.212.85.155/" target="_blank"> JSS InfoConnect </a> (20000+ users, 5000+ daily active users etc).</p>
